**🚀 Project Showcase: Customer Churn Data Normalization**

**📊 Problem Statement:**
Customer churn data often contains duplicates, redundancy, and inconsistencies, making analysis and predictions less accurate.

**🛠️ Concepts Used (Normalization):**

1NF: Removed repeating groups, ensured atomic values

2NF: Separated data into tables – Customers, Subscriptions, Transactions

3NF: Eliminated transitive dependencies

Used Primary & Foreign Keys for integrity and relationships

**✅ Impact:** Structured and clean dataset ready for accurate churn analysis, easier updates, and reliable insights.
